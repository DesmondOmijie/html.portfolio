 <h2>Watching Donghua</h2>

<p>I'm a big fan of Donghua (Chinese animation). <br>I love the storytelling, art style, and cultural themes. It’s not just entertainment — <br>it inspires creativity and teaches valuable lessons about persistence, honor, and growth.</p>

<h2> Coding for Fun</h2>

<p>Coding isn’t just a skill — it’s a passion. Whether I'm trying out new web <br> technologies, experimenting with front-end frameworks, or building small projects, I <br>genuinely enjoy the problem-solving process and the thrill of bringing ideas to life.</p>

<h2>Reading Novels</h2>
